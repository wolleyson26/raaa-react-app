        In the spirit of the predecessor organization (Rutgers African-American
        Alumni Alliance) which was founded in 1989, the organization was
        relaunched in 2001 by several Alumni on the New Brunswick campus when it
        hosted its first annual Family and Friends day during the Homecoming
        weekend. The event provided Alumni the opportunity to network and attend
        Homecoming festivities for which many never experienced while students
        at Rutgers. The event became the soundboard and vehicle for Alumni to
        reconnect with one another and more importantly, the Rutgers community.
        Throughout the years, RAAA, Inc. continues to have an ever increasing
        presence on campus as a means to enhance relationships with both the
        student body and the University. Incorporated in 2006, Rutgers African
        American Alumni Alliance (RAAA), Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit
        organization. It is an association of African-American, Afro-Caribbean
        and African Alumni encompassing all of Rutgers University's
        undergraduate and graduate schools. RAAA Inc., an all volunteer
        organization, operates independent of the University to support
        educational programming, cultural awareness and is primarily dependent
        upon membership dues, corporate and private donations to fund all
        programs and events. RAAA, Inc. strives to foster and enhance unity
        amongst Alumni, students, faculty and staff of African ancestry via our
        programming and active participation in the lives of our students. It is
        our goal to harness the potential of our Alumni network as we aim to be
        the voice of our constituents to affect positive change at Rutgers
        University and the community at large. It is our obligation as Alumni to
        support, encourage and develop our students while providing them with
        opportunities that may or may not have been afforded to us as we
        continue to highlight and celebrate the contributions of our fellow
        Alumni. As an all inclusive organization, RAAA, Inc. does not
        discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national or ethnic
        origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital or parental status,
        handicap, source of income, or status as a Vietnam-era or disabled
        veteran.
