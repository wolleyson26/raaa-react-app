      <h2>Supporting our Community</h2>
      Welcome to the online donations page for the Rutgers African American
      Alumni Alliance (RAAA), Inc. RAAA is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and
      an all volunteer organization, operates independently of the University to
      support educational programming, cultural awareness and is primarily
      dependent upon membership dues, corporate and private donations to fund
      all programs and events. As Rutgers Alumni, we are well aware of the
      benefits that we enjoy, including (but not limited to) a rich network of
      professionals, entrepreneurs and civic and non-profit leaders within and
      outside of the state of New Jersey. The students of Rutgers remain among
      the best and brightest in the world as they continue to find growth at
      Rutgers University intellectually, socially and professionally. RAAA, Inc.
      strives to foster and enhance unity amongst Alumni, students, faculty and
      staff of African ancestry via programming and active participation in the
      lives of our students. It is our goal to harness the potential of our
      Alumni network as we aim to be the voice of our constituents to affect
      positive change at Rutgers University and the community at large. It is
      our obligation as Alumni to support, encourage and develop our students
      while providing them with opportunities that may or may not have been
      afforded to us as we continue to highlight and celebrate the contributions
      of our fellow Alumni. We hope you can support our community in the
